## You need replit or any other programming website, replit will be the best one yet. This selfbot has an env/secret you will have to put "TOKEN" in key and your token in value
when you have done that save the secret/env and then you can go to config.json and fix your own setting the prefix you will start with is "," but you can change it while using 
the selfbot. The command is ,prefix (change the prefix to whatever you like).
